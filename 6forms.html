	<p>Three Korean terms may be used with reference to taekwondo forms or patterns. These forms are equivalent to kata in karate.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hyeong (sometimes romanized as hyung) is the term usually used in traditional taekwondo (i.e., 1950sâ€“1960s styles of Korean martial arts).</li>
			<li>Poomsae (sometimes romanized as pumsae or poomse) is the term officially used by Kukkiwon/WT-style and ATA-style taekwondo.</li>
			<li>Teul (sometimes romanized as tul) is the term usually used in ITF/Chang Hon-style taekwondo.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>A hyeong is a systematic, prearranged sequence of martial techniques that is performed either with or without the use of a weapon. In dojangs (taekwondo 
	training gymnasiums) hyeong are used primarily as a form of interval training that is useful in developing mushin, proper kinetics and mental and physical
	fortitude. Hyeong may resemble combat, but are artistically non-combative and woven together so as to be an effective conditioning tool. One's aptitude for
	a particular hyeong may be evaluated in competition. In such competitions, hyeong are evaluated by a panel of judges who base the score on many factors 
	including energy, precision, speed, and control. In Western competitions, there are two general classes of hyeong: creative and standard. Creative hyeong 
	are created by the performer and are generally acrobatic in nature and do not necessarily reflect the kinetic principles intrinsic in any martial system.
	</p>
	<p>Different taekwondo styles and associations (ATA, ITF, GTF, WT, etc.) use different taekwondo forms. Even within a single association, different schools
	in the association may use slightly different variations on the forms or use different names for the same form (especially in older styles of taekwondo). 
	This is especially true for beginner forms, which tend to be less standardized than mainstream forms.
