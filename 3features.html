	Taekwondo is characterized by its emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping and spinning kicks, and fast kicking techniques. In fact, World Taekwondo
	sparring competitions award additional points for strikes that incorporate spinning kicks, kicks to the head, or both. To facilitate fast, turning 
	kicks, taekwondo generally adopts stances that are narrower and taller than the broader, wide stances used by martial arts such as karate. The tradeoff 
	of decreased stability is believed to be worth the commensurate increase in agility, particularly in Kukkiwon-style taekwondo.<br><br>
	</p>
<h2>Theory of power</h2>
	<p>
	The emphasis on speed and agility is a defining characteristic of taekwondo and has its origins in analyses undertaken by Choi Hong Hi. The results 
	of that analysis are known by ITF practitioners as Choi's Theory of Power. Choi based his understanding of power on biomechanics and Newtonian physics
	as well as Chinese martial arts. For example, Choi observed that the power of a strike increases quadratically with the speed of the strike, but 
	increases only linearly with the mass of the striking object. In other words, speed is more important than size in terms of generating power. This 
	principle was incorporated into the early design of taekwondo and is still used.<br><br>
	Choi also advocated a relax/strike principle for taekwondo; in other words, between blocks, kicks, and strikes the practitioner should relax the 
	body, then tense the muscles only while performing the technique. It is believed that the relax/strike principle increases the power of the technique,
	by conserving the body's energy. He expanded on this principle with his advocacy of the sine wave technique. This involves raising one's centre of 
	gravity between techniques, then lowering it as the technique is performed, producing the up-and-down movement from which the term "sine wave" is 
	derived. The sine wave is generally practiced, however, only in schools that follow ITF-style taekwondo. Kukkiwon-style taekwondo, for example, does 
	not employ the sine wave and advocates a more uniform height during movements, drawing power mainly from the rotation of the hip.<br><br>
	</p>
<div>The components of the Theory of Power include:</div><br>
	<ul>
			<li>Reaction Force - the principle that as the striking limb is brought forward, other parts of the body should be brought backwards in order to provide
				more power to the striking limb. As an example, if the right leg is brought forward in a roundhouse kick, the right arm is brought backwards to provide the reaction force.</li>
			<li>Concentration - the principle of bringing as many muscles as possible to bear on a strike, concentrating the area of impact into as 
				small an area as possible.</li>
			<li>Equilibrium - maintaining a correct centre-of-balance throughout a technique.</li>
			<li>Breath Control - the idea that during a strike one should exhale, with the exhalation concluding at the moment of impact.</li>
			<li>Mass - the principle of bringing as much of the body to bear on a strike as possible; again using the turning kick as an example, 
				the idea would be to rotate the hip as well as the leg during the kick in order to take advantage of the hip's additional mass in terms
				of providing power to the kick.</li>
			<li>Speed - as previously noted, the speed of execution of a technique in taekwondo is deemed to be even more important than mass in terms
					of providing power.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>Typical curriculum</h2>
<img src=".\images\18.png" align="left" width="35%" height="50%>">
	While organizations such as ITF or Kukkiwon define the general style of taekwondo, individual clubs and schools tend to tailor their taekwondo 
	practices. Although each taekwondo club or school is different, a student typically takes part in most or all of the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Forms (pumsae 품새, hyeong 형 or teul 틀) - these serve the same function as kata in the study of karate</li>
			<li>Sparring (gyeorugi 겨루기 or matseogi 맞서기) - sparring includes variations such as freestyle sparring (in which competitors spar without
				interruption for several minutes); 7-, 3-, 2-, and 1-step sparring (in which students practice pre-arranged sparring combinations); and 
				point sparring (in which sparring is interrupted and then resumed after each point is scored)</li>
			<li>Breaking (gyeokpa 격파 or weerok) - the breaking of boards is used for testing, training, and martial arts demonstrations. Demonstrations 
				often also incorporate bricks, tiles, and blocks of ice or other materials. These techniques can be separated into three types: </li>
				<ul type="square">
					<li>Power breaking – using straightforward techniques to break as many boards as possible </li>
					<li>Speed breaking – boards are held loosely by one edge, putting special focus on the speed required to perform the break </li>
					<li>Special techniques – breaking fewer boards but using jumping or flying techniques to attain greater height, distance, or to 
						clear obstacles</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Self-defense techniques (hosinsul 호신술) </li>
			<li>Learning the fundamental techniques of taekwondo; these generally include kicks, blocks, punches, and strikes, with somewhat less 
				emphasis on grappling and holds </li>
			<li>Throwing and/or falling techniques (deonjigi 던지기 or tteoreojigi 떨어지기) </li>
			<li>Both anaerobic and aerobic workout, including stretching </li>
			<li>Relaxation and meditation exercises, as well as breathing control </li>
			<li>A focus on mental and ethical discipline, etiquette, justice, respect, and self-confidence </li>
			<li>Examinations to progress to the next rank </li>
			<li>Development of personal success and leadership skills </li>
		</ul>
		Though weapons training is not a formal part of most taekwondo federation curricula, individual schools will often incorporate additional
		training with staffs, knives, sticks, etc.
