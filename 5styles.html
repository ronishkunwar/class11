<h1>Styles and organizations</h1><hr>
<img src=".\images\15.jpg" align="left" width="35%" height="50%">
	<p>
	There are a number of major taekwondo styles as well as a few niche styles. Most styles are associated with a governing body or federation that defines
	the style. The major technical differences among taekwondo styles and organizations generally revolve around:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the patterns practiced by each style (called hyeong 형, pumsae 품새, or teul 틀, depending on the style); these are sets of prescribed formal 
			sequences of movements that demonstrate mastery of posture, positioning, and technique</li>
			<li>differences in the sparring rules for competition.</li>
			<li>martial arts philosophy.</li>
		</ul>
<h2>1946: Traditional taekwondo</h2>
	<p>The term traditional taekwondo typically refers to martial arts practised in Korea during the 1940s and 1950s by the nine original kwans, or martial
	arts schools, after the conclusion of the Japanese occupation of Korea at the end of World War II. The term taekwondo had not yet been coined, and in 
	reality, each of the nine original kwans practised its own style of martial arts. The term traditional taekwondoserves mostly as an umbrella term for 
	these various styles, as they themselves used various other names such as Tang Soo Do (Chinese Hand Way), Kong Soo Do (Empty Hand Way) and Tae Soo Do (
	Foot Hand Way). Traditional Taekwondo is still studied today but generally under other names, such as Tang Soo Do and Soo Bahk Do. In 1959, the name 
	Taekwondo was agreed upon by the nine original kwans as a common term for their martial arts. As part of the unification process, The Korea Taekwondo 
	Association (KTA) was formed through a collaborative effort by representatives from all the kwans, and the work began on a common curriculum, which 
	eventually resulted in the Kukkiwon and the Kukki Style of Taekwondo. The original kwans that formed KTA continues to exist today, but as independent 
	fraternal membership organizations that support the World Taekwondo Federation and Kukkiwon. The kwans also function as a channel for the issuing of 
	Kukkiwon dan and poom certification (black belt ranks) for their members. The official curriculum of those kwans that joined the unification is that of
	the Kukkiwon, with the notable exception of half the Oh Do Kwan which joined the ITF instead and therefore uses the Chan Hon curriculum.
	</p>
<h2>1966: ITF/Chang Hon-style taekwondo</h2>
<img src=".\images\12.jpg" align="right" width="35%" height="50%">
	<p>International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF)-style taekwondo, more accurately known as Chang Hon-style taekwondo, is defined by Choi Hong Hi's 
	Encyclopedia of Taekwon-dopublished in 1987. In 1990, the Global Taekwondo Federation (GTF) split from the ITF due to the political controversies
	surrounding the ITF; the GTF continues to practice ITF-style taekwondo, however, with additional elements incorporated into the style. Likewise, the ITF
	itself split in 2001 and again in 2002 into three separate federations, headquartered in Austria, the United Kingdom, and Spain respectively. The GTF and 
	all three ITFs practice Choi's ITF-style taekwondo. In ITF-style taekwondo, the word used for "forms" is teul; the specific set of teul used by the ITF is
	called Chang Hon. Choi defined 24 Chang Hon teul. The names and symbolism of the Chang Hon teul refer to elements of Korean history, culture and religious
	philosophy. The GTF-variant of ITF practices an additional six teul.
	</p>
<div>
	Within the ITF taekwondo tradition there are two sub-styles:<br>
</div>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>The style of taekwondo practised by the ITF before its 1973 split with the KTA is sometimes called by ITF practitioners "traditional taekwondo", 
			though a more accurate term would be traditional ITF taekwondo.</li>
		<li>After the 1973 split, Choi Hong Hi continued to develop and refine the style, ultimately publishing his work in his 1987 Encyclopedia of Taekwondo. 
			Among the refinements incorporated into this new sub-style is the "sine wave"; one of Choi Hong Hi's later principles of taekwondo is that the 
			body's centre of gravity should be raised-and-lowered throughout a movement.</li>
	</ul>
	<div>		
	Some ITF schools adopt the sine wave style, while others do not. Essentially all ITF schools do, however, use the patterns (teul) defined in the 
	Encyclopedia, with some exceptions related to the forms Juche and Ko-Dang.<bt>
	</div>
<h2>1969: ATA/Songahm-style taekwondo</h2>
	<p>In 1969, Haeng Ung Lee, a former taekwondo instructor in the South Korean military, relocated to Omaha, Nebraska and established a chain of martial 
	arts schools in the United States under the banner of the American Taekwondo Association (ATA). Like Jhoon Rhee Taekwondo, ATA taekwondo has its roots 
	in traditional taekwondo. The style of taekwondo practised by the ATA is called Songahm taekwondo. The ATA went on to become one of the largest chains 
	of taekwondo schools in the United States. 
	</p>
	<p>The ATA established international spin-offs called the Songahm Taekwondo Federation (STF) and the World Traditional Taekwondo Union (WTTU) to promote 
	the practice of Songahm taekwondo internationally. In 2015, all the spin-offs were reunited under the umbrella of ATA International.
	</p>
<h2>1970s: Jhoon Rhee-style taekwondo</h2>
<img src=".\images\11.jpg" align="left" width="35%" height="50%">
	<p>In 1962 Jhoon Rhee relocated to the United States and established a chain of martial arts schools primarily in the Washington, D.C. area that practised 
	traditional taekwondo. In the 1970s, at the urging of Choi Hong Hi, Rhee adopted ITF-style taekwondo within his chain of schools, but like the GTF later 
	departed from the ITF due to the political controversies surrounding Choi and the ITF. Rhee went on to develop his own style of taekwondo called Jhoon 
	Rhee-style taekwondo, incorporating elements of both traditional and ITF-style taekwondo as well as original elements. (Note that Jhoon Rhee-style 
	taekwondo is distinct from the similarly named Rhee Taekwon-Do, based in Australia and New Zealand).
	</p>
	<div>
	Jhoon Rhee-style taekwondo is still practised primarily in the United States and eastern Europe.<br>
	</div>
<h2>1972: Kukki-style / WT-taekwondo</h2>
	<p>In 1972 the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA) Central Dojang opened in Seoul in 1972; in 1973 the name was changed to Kukkiwon. Under the sponsorship 
	of the South Korean government's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism the Kukkiwon became the new national academy for taekwondo, thereby establishing
	a new "unified" style of taekwondo.  In 1973 the KTA established the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF, now called World Taekwondo, WT) to promote taekwondo
	as a sport. The International Olympic Committee recognized the WT and taekwondo sparring in 1980. For this reason, the Kukkiwon-defined style of taekwondo 
	is sometimes referred to as Sport-style taekwondo, Olympic-style taekwondo, or WT-style taekwondo, but the style itself is defined by the Kukkiwon, not by
	the WT, and the WT competition ruleset itself only allows the use of a very small number of the total number of techniques included in the style. 
	Therefore, the correct term for the South Korean government sponsored style of Taekwondo associated with the Kukkiwon, is Kukki Taekwondo, meaning 
	"national taekwondo" in Korean.
	</p>
	<p>In Kukki-style taekwondo, the word used for "forms" is poomsae. In 1967 the KTA established a new set of forms called the Palgwae poomse, named after 
	the eight trigrams of the I Ching. In 1971 however (after additional kwans had joined the KTA), the KTA and Kukkiwon adopted a new set of color-belt 
	forms instead, called the Taegeuk poomsae. Black belt forms are called yudanja poomsae. While ITF-style forms refer to key elements of Korean history,
	Kukki-style forms refer instead to elements of sino-Korean philosophy such as the I Ching and the taegeuk.
	</p>
	<p>WT-sanctioned tournaments allow any person, regardless of school affiliation or martial arts style, to compete in WT events as long as he or she is a
	member of the WT Member National Association in his or her nation; this allows essentially anyone to compete in WT-sanctioned competitions.
	</p>
<h2>Other styles and hybrid</h2>
<img src=".\images\13.jpg" align="right" width="35%" height="50%">
	<p>As previously mentioned, in 1990 the Global Taekwondo Federation (GTF) split from the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) to form its own style of 
	taekwondo based on ITF-style. Essentially this can be considered a variation of ITF-style.
	</p>
	<p>Also in 1990, martial artist and actor Chuck Norris, an alumnus of Hwang Kee's Moo Duk Kwan organization, established a hybrid martial art system 
	called Chun Kuk Do. Chun Kuk Do shares many techniques, forms and names with Tang Soo Do and Taekwondo, and so can be considered a variation of 
	traditional taekwondo. Similarly, Lim Ching Sing's Hup Kwon Do and Kwang-jo Choi's Choi Kwang Do also derive from taekwondo.
	</p>
	<p>Additionally, there are hybrid martial arts that combine taekwondo with other styles. These include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Kun Gek Do (also Gwon Gyokdo) - combines taekwondo and muay thai.</li>
		<li>Han Moo Do - Scandinavian martial art that combines taekwondo, hapkido, and hoi jeon moo sool.</li>
		<li>Han Mu Do - Korean martial art that combines taekwondo and hapkido.</li>
		<li>Teukgong Moosool - Korean martial art that combines elements of taekwondo, hapkido, judo, kyuk too ki, and Chinese martial arts.</li>
		<li>Yongmudo - developed at Korea's Yong-In University, combines taekwondo, hapkido, judo, and ssireum.</li>
	</ul>
