	A taekwondo student typically wears a uniform (dobok 도복), often white but sometimes black (or other colors), with a belt tied around the waist. White 
	uniforms are considered the traditional color and are usually encouraged for use at formal ceremonies such as belt tests and promotions. Colored uniforms 
	are often reserved for special teams (such as demonstration teams or leadership teams) or higher-level instructors. There are at least three major styles 
	of dobok, with the most obvious differences being in the style of jacket:
	</p>
	<ol type="1" start="1">
		<li>The cross-over front jacket (usually seen in ITF style), in which the opening of the jacket is vertical.</li>
		<li>The cross-over Y-neck jacket (usually seen in the Kukkiwon/WT style, especially for poomase competitions), in which the opening of the jacket 
			crosses the torso diagonally.</li>
		<li>The pull-over V-neck jacket (usually seen in Kukkiwon/WT style, especially for sparring competitions).</li>
	</ol>

<p>
	White uniforms in the Kukkiwon/WT tradition will typically be white throughout the jacket (black trim along the collars only for dan grades), while 
	ITF-style uniforms are usually trimmed with a black border along the collar and bottom of the jacket (for dan grades). The belt color and any insignia 
	thereon indicate the student's rank. Different clubs and schools use different color schemes for belts. In general, the darker the color, the higher the 
	rank. Taekwondo is traditionally performed in bare feet, although martial arts training shoes may sometimes be worn.

	When sparring, padded equipment is usually worn. In the ITF tradition, typically only the hands and feet are padded. For this reason, ITF sparring often 
	employs only light-contact sparring. In the Kukkiwon/WT tradition, full-contact sparring is facilitated by the employment of more extensive equipment: 
	padded helmets called homyun are always worn, as are padded torso protectors called hogu; feet, shins, groins, hands, and forearms protectors are also 
	worn.
</p>
<p>
	The school or place where instruction is given is called the dojang (도장). Specifically, the term dojang refers to the area within the school in which 
	martial arts instruction takes place; the word dojang is sometimes translated as gymnasium. In common usage, the term dojang is often used to refer to 
	the school as a whole. Modern dojangs often incorporate padded flooring, often incorporating red-and-blue patterns in the flooring to reflect the colors 
	of the taegeuk symbol. Some dojangs have wooden flooring instead. The dojang is usually decorated with items such as flags, banners, belts, instructional 
	materials, and traditional Korean calligraphy.
