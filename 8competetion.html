<h1>Competition</h1><hr>

	<p>Taekwondo competition typically involves sparring, breaking, and patterns; some tournaments also include special events such as demonstration teams and self-defense (hosinsul). In Olympic taekwondo competition, however, only sparring (using WT competition rules) is performed. 
	</p>
	<p>There are two kinds of competition sparring: point sparring, in which all strikes are light contact and the clock is stopped when a point is scored; and Olympic sparring, where all strikes are full contact and the clock continues when points are scored. Sparring involves a Hogu, or a chest protector, which muffles any kick's damage to avoid serious injuries. Helmets and other gear are provided as well. Though other systems may vary, a common point system works like this: One point for a regular kick to the Hogu, two for a turning behind the kick, three for a back kick, and four for a spinning kick
	to the head.
	</p><br>
<h2>World Taekwondo (WT) Competition</h2>
	<p>Under World Taekwondo (WT, formerly WTF) and Olympic rules, sparring is a full-contact event and takes place between two competitors in either an area measuring 8  meters square or an octagon of similar size.[43] Competitors are matched within gender and weight division - 8 divisions for World 
	Championships that are condensed to 4 for the Olympics. A win can occur by points, or if one competitor is unable to continue (knockout). However, there 
	are several decisions that can lead to a win, as well, including superiority, withdrawal, disqualification, or even a referee's punitive declaration. Each
	match consists of three two-minute rounds, with one minute rest between rounds, though these are often abbreviated or shortened for some junior and 
	regional tournaments. Competitors must wear a hogu, head protector, shin pads, foot socks, forearm guards, hand gloves, a mouthpiece, and a groin cup. 
	Tournaments sanctioned by national governing bodies or the WT, including the Olympics and World Championship, use electronic hogus, electronic foot socks,
	and electronic head protectors to register and determine scoring techniques, with human judges used to assess and score technical (spinning) techniques
	and score punches.
	</p>
	<p>Points are awarded for permitted techniques delivered to the legal scoring areas, as determined by the electronic scoring system, which assesses the strength and location of the contact. The only techniques allowed are kicks (delivering a strike using an area of the foot below the ankle) and punches (delivering a strike using the closed fist). In some smaller tournaments, and in the past, points were awarded by three corner judges using electronic 
	scoring tallies. All major national and international tournaments have moved fully (as of 2017) to electronic scoring, including the use of electronic 
	headgear. This limits corner judges to scoring only technical points and punches. Some believe that the new electronic scoring system reduces controversy
	concerning judging decisions, but this technology is still not universally accepted. In particular, the move to electronic headgear has replaced 
	controversy over judging with controversy over how the technology has changed the sport. Because the headgear is not able to determine if a kick was a 
	correct taekwondo technique, and the pressure threshold for sensor activation for headgear is kept low for safety reasons, athletes who improvised ways of
	placing their foot on their opponents head were able to score points, regardless of how true to taekwondo those techniques were. 
	</p>

	<p>A punch that makes contact with the opponent's hogu (the body guard that functions as a scoring target) scores one point, while a kick scores two points. (The trunk protector is referred to as a momtong pohodae 몸통 보호대 or trunk guard in the WT rules.) If a kick to the hogu involves a technique that includes fully turning the attacking competitor's body, so that the back is fully exposed to the targeted competitor during execution of the tech0nique (spinning kick), three points are awarded. A kick to the head scores three points; as of October 2010 an additional point is awarded if a turning kick was used to execute this attack, making a spinning head kick worth 4 points. Punches to the head are not allowed. As of October 2017, no additional points are awarded for knocking down an opponent (beyond the normal points awarded for legal strikes).
	</p>
	<p>The referee can give penalties at any time for rule-breaking, such as hitting an area not recognized as a target, usually the legs or neck. Penalties, called "Gam-jeom" are counted as an addition of one point for the opposing contestant. Following 10 "Gam-jeom" a player is declared the loser by referee's punitive declaration.
	</p>
	<p>At the end of three rounds, the competitor with most points wins the match. In the event of a tie, a fourth "sudden death" overtime round, sometimes called a "Golden Point", is held to determine the winner after a one-minute rest period. In this round, the first competitor to score a point wins the match. If there is no score in the additional round, the winner is decided by superiority, as determined by the refereeing officials or number of fouls committed during that round.
	</p>
	<p>If a competitor has a 20-point lead at the end of the second round or achieves a 20-point lead at any point in the third round, then the match is over and that competitor is declared the winner. 
	</p>
	<p>USA Taekwondo is the officially recognized National Governing Body for Taekwondo for the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), and the official Member National Association of the World Taekwondo Federation.
	</p>
	<p>In addition to sparring competition, World Taekwondo sanctions competition in poomsae or forms, although this is not an Olympic event. Single competitors perform a designated pattern of movements, and are assessed by judges for accuracy (accuracy of movements, balance, precision of details) and presentation (speed and power, rhythm, energy), both of which receive numerical scores, with deductions made for errors. Pair and team competition is also
	recognized, where two or more competitors perform the same form at the same time. In addition to competition with the traditional forms, there is 
	experimentation with freestyle forms that allow more creativity.

		</ul>
<h2>International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) Competition</h2>
 	<p>The International Taekwon-Do Federation's sparring rules are similar to the WT's rules but differ in several aspects.</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Hand attacks to the head are allowed.</li>
			<li>The competition is not full contact, and excessive contact is not allowed.</li>
			<li>Competitors are penalized with disqualification if they injure their opponent and he can no longer continue (knockout).</li>
			<li>The scoring system is:</li>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>point for Punch to the body or head.</li>
					<li>points for Jumping kick to the body or kick to the head</li>
					<li>points for Jumping kick to the head</li>
				</ol>
			<li>The competition area may vary between 10×10 meters and 20×20 meters in international championships.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Competitors do not wear the hogu (although they are required to wear approved foot and hand protection equipment, as well as optional head guards).
	This scoring system varies between individual organisations within the ITF; for example, in the TAGB, punches to the head or body score 1 point, kicks 
	to the body score 2 points, and kicks to the head score 3 points.
	</p>
	<p>A continuous point system is utilized in ITF competition, where the fighters are allowed to continue after scoring a technique. Excessive contact are
	generally not allowed according to the official ruleset, and judges penalize any competitor with disqualification if they injure their opponent and he can
	no longer continue (although these rules vary between ITF organizations). At the end of two minutes (or some other specified time), the competitor with 
	more scoring techniques wins.
	</p>
	<p>Fouls in ITF sparring include: attacking a fallen opponent, leg sweeping, holding/grabbing, or intentional attack to a target other than the opponent.</p>
	<p>ITF competitions also feature performances of patterns, breaking, and 'special techniques' (where competitors perform prescribed board breaks at great
	heights).</p>

<h2>Other organizations</h2>
	<p>American Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) competitions are very similar, except that different styles of pads and gear are allowed.</p>
	<p>Apart from WT and ITF tournaments, major taekwondo competitions (all featuring WT taekwondo only) include:</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Universiade</li>
			<li>Asian Games</li>
			<li>African Games</li>
			<li>European Games</li>
			<li>Pan American Games</li>
			<li>Pacific Games</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Taekwondo is also an optional sport at the Commonwealth Games.</p>
